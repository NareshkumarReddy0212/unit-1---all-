1. Initialize a Git Repository Locally (git init)
➤ Steps:
1.	Open Terminal or Git Bash
2.	Create a project folder
mkdir portfolio-site
cd portfolio-site
3.	Initialize Git:
git init
This creates a hidden .git folder inside the directory.

2. Create a Sample HTML File
echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>My Portfolio</title></head><body><h1>Welcome!</h1></body></html>" > index.html

3. Commit Changes (git add, git commit)
➤ Steps:
git add index.html
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added basic portfolio page"
This saves the changes to the local repository.

4. Create a New Branch (git branch)
➤ Steps:
git branch about
git checkout about
Or shortcut:
git checkout -b about
You are now working on a separate branch named about.

5. Make Changes on Branch and Commit
Open index.html and add the following before </body>:
<p>This is the about section.</p>
Then:
git add index.html
git commit -m "Added about section"

6. Merge Branch with Main (git merge)
Switch to main branch:
git checkout ( go to main)
Then merge:
git merge about
Changes from about branch are now merged into main.

7. Push to GitHub (Remote Version Control)
➤ Steps:
1.	Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., portfolio-site)
2.	Connect local repo to GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio-site.git
git push -u origin main

8. Clone Repository (git clone)
You can now clone the repository on another system or folder:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio-site.git
This copies the entire project (including history and branches) to a new location.
